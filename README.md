> **Abstract:** *In this work, we address the challenging and emergent problem of novel object detection (NOD), focusing on the accurate detection of both known and novel object categories during inference. Traditional object detection algorithms are inherently closed-set, limiting their capability to handle NOD. We present a novel approach to transform existing closed-set detectors into open-set detectors. This transformation is achieved by leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained foundational models, specifically CLIP and SAM, through our cooperative mechanism. Furthermore, by integrating this mechanism with state-of-the-art open-set detectors such as GDINO, we establish new benchmarks in object detection performance. Our method achieves 17.42 mAP in novel object detection and 42.08 mAP for known objects on the challenging LVIS dataset. Adapting our approach to the COCO OVD split, we surpass the current state-of-the-art by a margin of 7.2 AP<sub>50</sub> for novel classes.*

## :trophy: Achievements and Features

- We establish **state-of-the-art results (SOTA)** in novel object detection on LVIS, and open-vocabulary detection benchmark on COCO.
- We propose a simple, modular, and training-free approach which can detect (i.e. localize and classify) known as well as novel objects in the given input image.
- Our approach easily transforms any existing closed-set detectors into open-set detectors by leveraging the complimentary strengths of foundational models like CLIP and SAM.
- The modular nature of our approach allows us to easily swap out any specific component, and further combine it with existing SOTA open-set detectors to achieve additional performance improvements.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup and Installation
We have used `python=3.8.15`, and `torch=1.10.1` for all the code in this repository. It is recommended to follow the below steps and setup your conda environment in the same way to replicate the results mentioned in this paper and repository.

1. Clone this repository into your local machine as follows:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:rohit901/cooperative-foundational-models.git
```
or
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohit901/cooperative-foundational-models.git
```
2. Change the current directory to the main project folder (cooperative-foundational-models):
```bash
cd cooperative-foundational-models
```
3. To install the project dependencies and libraries, use [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and install the defined environment from the .yml file by running:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
4. Activate the newly created conda environment:
```bash
conda activate coop_foundation_models 
```
5. Install the [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) v0.6 library via pip:
```bash
python -m pip install detectron2 -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/cu113/torch1.10/index.html
```

### Datasets
To download and setup the required datasets used in this work, please follow these steps:
1. Download the COCO2017 dataset from their official website: [https://cocodataset.org/#download](https://cocodataset.org/#download). Specfically, download `2017 Train images`, `2017 Val images`, `2017 Test images`, and their annotation files `2017 Train/Val annotations`.
2. Download the LVIS v1.0 annotations from: [https://www.lvisdataset.org/dataset](https://www.lvisdataset.org/dataset). There is no need to download images from this website as LVIS uses the same COCO2017 images. Specifically download the annotation files corresponding to the training set (1GB), and validation set (192 MB).
3. Download extra/custom annotation files for COCO open-vocabulary splits from: [COCO-OVD-Annotations](https://mbzuaiac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rohit_bharadwaj_mbzuai_ac_ae/EgiIumWrcqhGpanKRaYfGYsBOga7V4fgDHcz_W_ys8UVLg?e=Qq0gfT), specifically download both `ovd_instances_train2017_base.json`, and `ovd_instances_val2017_basetarget.json`.
4. Download extra/custom annotation file for `lvis_val_subset` dataset from: [LVIS-Val-Subset](https://mbzuaiac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rohit_bharadwaj_mbzuai_ac_ae/ErCHDEIltBNBpnedS2S0TUsBFHs1SmVTM525z6ukoiMFLw?e=QPBEL0), specifically download `lvis_v1_val_subset.json`.
5. Detectron2 requires you to setup the datasets in a specific folder format/structure, for that it uses the environment variable `DETECTRON2_DATASETS` which is set equal to the path of the location containing all the different datasets. The file structure of `DETECTRON2_DATASETS` should be as follows:
- `coco/`
  - `annotations/`
    - `instances_train2017.json`
    - `instances_val2017.json`
    - `ovd_instances_train2017_base.json`
    - `ovd_instances_val2017_basetarget.json`
    - `..other coco annotation json files (optional)..`
  - `train2017/`
  - `val2017/`
  - `test2017/`
- `lvis/`
  - `lvis_v1_val.json`
  - `lvis_v1_train.json`
  - `lvis_v1_val_subset.json`

 The above file structure can also be seen from this onedrive link: [link](https://mbzuaiac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rohit_bharadwaj_mbzuai_ac_ae/Ej02TuxaTthBrD-yKSOd0SYByEwb5Hqq17Kv4V21AOohkQ?e=H7G9I5). Thus, the value for `DETECTRON2_DATASETS` or `detectron2_dir` in our code file should be the absolute path to the `datasets` directory which follows the above structure.

 ### Model Weights
 All the pre-trained model weights can be downloaded from this link: [model weights](https://mbzuaiac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rohit_bharadwaj_mbzuai_ac_ae/EpiLUqdhaSxKjB_BjVXCrmAB4cEGNbg3ilGppX5FTQ9sFA?e=EyZs0k). The folder contains the following model weights:

 - **GDINO_weights.pth**: Grounding DINO model weights used in both Novel Object Detection, and Open Vocabulary Detection tasks. Edit the key corresponding to `gdino_checkpoint` in `params.json` file to point to this file.
 - **SAM_weights.pth** Segment Anything Model (SAM) weights used in both Novel Object Detection, and Open Vocabulary Detection tasks. Edit the key corresponding to `sam_checkpoint` in `params.json` file to point to this file.
 - **maskrcnn_v2** Folder containing the weights of trained Mask-RCNN V2 model on COCO datset. These weights are used only in Novel Object Detection task. Do not rename the folder name or the model weight inside the folder, edit the key corresponding to `rcnn_weight_dir` in `scripts/novel_object_detection/params.json` file to point to this folder.
 - **moco_v2_800ep_pretrain.pkl** Initial pre-trained checkpoint for Mask-RCNN. These are used when training Mask-RCNN from scratch on the COCO OVD data split, and thus only used in Open Vocabulary Detection task. Edit the value of `CHECKPOINT_PATH` in `scripts/open_vocab_detection/train_mask_rcnn/train.batch` to point to this file.
 - **MaskRCNN_COCO_OVD** Folder containing the weights of trained Mask-RCNN model on COCO OVD data split. These weights are used only to evaluate performance in Open Vocabulary Detection task. Do not rename folder name or model weight inside the folder, edit the key corresponding to `rcnn_weight_dir` in `scripts/open_vocab_detection/evaluate_method/params.json` file to point to this folder.

**Table 1:** Comparison of object detection performance using mAP on the *lvis_val* dataset.

To replicate our results from the above table (i.e. Table 1 from the main paper):
1. Modify `scripts/novel_object_detection/params.json` file:
   - Edit the key `detectron2_dir` and set it following instructions in [Datasets](#datasets)
   - Edit the key `sam_checkpoint` and set the path to the downloaded file `SAM_weights.pth`
   - Edit the key `gdino_checkpoint` and set the path to the downloaded file `GDINO_weights.pth`
   - Edit the key `rcnn_weight_dir` and set the path to the downloaded folder `maskrcnn_v2` [**NOTE:** DO NOT put a trailing slash]
  
2. Run the following script from the main project directory as follows:
   ```bash
   python scripts/novel_object_detection/main.py
   ```
The above script periodically saves the predictions output in the `outputs` directory which is automatically created in the project level folder (i.e. `cooperative-foundational-models/outputs`). After executing the above script, the results will be printed to the console. Further, the final combined predictions of all the 19809 images in LVIS val dataset is saved as `instances_predictions.pth`, and can be used with `scripts/novel_object_detection/evaluate_results_from_predictions.py` to compute the final results.

**NOTE:** We were able to get slightly better overall result with our method using the code in this repository compared to the reported results in the paper:
| Method | Known AP | Novel AP | ALL AP |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Ours (Paper)    | 42.08    | 17.42    | 19.33  |
| Ours (GitHub)   | 45.43    | 17.25    | 19.43  |

### Inference on Custom Images
To detect LVIS class vocab (1203 classes) on your custom images:
1. Please follow the previous instructions to properly setup the data, `params.json`, and the environment.
2. Run `python scripts/novel_object_detection/inference_single_image.py --image_path custom_image.jpg`, you can replace custom_image.jpg with your own image and change the path accordingly.

The above script by default generates bounding box visualization of top-5 high scoring boxes. You may change the top-k visualization parameter by modifying the script. Alternatively, you may also choose to visualize the outputs based on confidence score threshold.

**Table 2:**  Results on COCO OVD benchmark.
*Our approach with GDINO, SigLIP, and Mask-RCNN trained on COCO OVD split.

To replicate our results from the above table (i.e. Table 2 from the main paper):
1. Obtain the trained Mask-RCNN model weights on COCO OVD dataset split.
   - Train the Mask-RCNN model from scratch:
      - Edit the values of `DETECTRON2_DATASETS`, `CHECKPOINT_PATH` in `scripts/open_vocab_detection/train_mask_rcnn/train.batch`
      - Start training by running: `bash scripts/open_vocab_detection/train_mask_rcnn/train.batch`
   - Alternatively, download the pre-trained weights of Mask-RCNN trained on COCO OVD from [Model Weights](#model-weights), and edit `detectron2_dir`, `sam_checkpoint`, `gdino_checkpoint`, and `rcnn_weight_dir` values in `scripts/open_vocab_detection/evaluate_method/params.json` accordingly. For `rcnn_weight_dir` set the path to the downloaded folder `MaskRCNN_COCO_OVD` **without trailing slash**.
  
2. Run the following script from main project directory as follows:
   ```bash
   python scripts/open_vocab_detection/evaluate_method/main.py
   ```

After executing the above script, the results will be displayed on the console. Ensure you follow the proper installation and setup steps mentioned in [Datasets](#datasets), and [Model Weights](#model-weights).
